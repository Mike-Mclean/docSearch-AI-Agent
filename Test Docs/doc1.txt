Client Investment Policy Statement

This Investment Policy Statement outlines the objectives, risk tolerance, and investment constraints of the client.

The primary objective of the portfolio is long-term capital appreciation with moderate risk. The client has a time horizon of 10 to 15 years and is willing to tolerate short-term market volatility in exchange for higher expected returns.

The target asset allocation is as follows:
- 60% equities
- 30% fixed income securities
- 10% cash and cash equivalents

Portfolio rebalancing will occur on a semi-annual basis or when asset class allocations deviate by more than 5% from their targets.

The client requires sufficient liquidity to cover expected living expenses and emergency needs. No investments may be made in speculative derivatives or unregistered securities.
